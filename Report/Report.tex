\begin{abstract}
This report describes the research, design, build and test of a stereoscopic robot using two Omnivision OV7670 cameras and an Atmel AT32UC3C0512C Microcontroller. A custom PCB was designed to fit a wheeled base. The report is in two main parts, hardware design and vision algorithms. The hardware design section describes the prototypes and design of the subsystems. The PCB that was designed is also tested.

The vision algorithms section discusses range finding from stereo images, comparison algorithms between stereo pairs and the implementation and test of a two dimensional fast Fourier transform on an AVR. 

The final product is a small mobile robot equipped with cameras and capability of image processing. The device has the ability to roam unintelligently and capture photos or be used as a command line terminal to control by a user.

\acknowledgements{I would like to thank Professor Steve Gunn whose help throughout the year was invaluable and for the weekly meetings no matter where he was in the world. I would also like to thank my friends and family for their support and help throughout my degree and with proof reading, to Tom for our years of being lab partners during our time here, and finally to Alice for asking the two golden questions that solved 90\% of my problems whenever I had one; ``Is it connected?'' and ``Is it switched on?''. \\ \\ All work presented in this report is my own unless otherwise stated or referenced.}
