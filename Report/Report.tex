This report describes the research, design, build and test of a stereoscopic vision robot using two cameras and an Atmel Microcontroller. A custom PCB was designed to fit a wheeled base. 

The report is in two main parts, hardware design and vision algorithms. The hardware design section describes the prototypes and design of the subsystems.
The vision algorithms section discusses range finding from stereo images, comparison algorithms between stereo pairs and the implementation and test of a two dimensional fast Fourier transform on an AVR. 

The final product is a small mobile robot equipped with cameras and capability of image processing. The device has the ability to execute a predefined set of commands in an automatic stand alone way. The robot can also be used as a shell terminal to debug and remote control.

I would also like to thank my friends and family for their support and help throughout my degree and with proof reading, to Tom for our years of being lab partners during our time here, and finally to Alice for asking the two golden questions that solved 90\% of my problems whenever I had one; ``Is it connected?'' and ``Is it switched on?''. \\ \\ All work presented in this report is my own unless otherwise stated or referenced.}
