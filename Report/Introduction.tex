The original idea for the project was a stereoscopic mapping robot, similar to \cite{Pirobot}. This would autonomously searched an area and return an occupancy map \cite{thrun2003learning}. However, due to time constraints, the vision part of the project was not implemented. The end robot is able to capture stereo image pairs, move with reasonable accuracy and do some image processing. The theory for distance measuring is discussed and prototyped in MATLAB but is not implemented on the AVR.

Stereoscopy in computer vision is the ability to calculate the locations and depths using images from two or more cameras, which are used to triangulate and estimate distances \citep{Saxena:DepthEstimation}. By using two cameras on the same plane, separated by a set horizontal distance, the depth of the observed scene can be perceived by the system.

Stereovision is a small section of computer vision which is widely used in many applications, including Microsoft's Xbox Kinect \citep{Microsoft:Kinect}, where stereo vision is used to locate a game player in order to use their movements to control the game. \cite{Mrovlje:Distance_Stereoscopic} uses stereovision to be able to locate the distance to a marker. 

The stereovision robot discussed in this report is a low cost alternative to other robots which use laser range finders or high quality cameras \citep{Se:MappingRobot}. The robot will use the base seen in figure \ref{fig:RobotBase} and use two OmniVision OV7670 cameras delivering QVGA format images.

The final robot designed could be used for a variety of applications. As a mapping robot, the device could be used by estate agents to measure room sizes. The robot could also be adapted to stream the camera data to a remote computer and be controlled by a user to explore unknown and potentially hostile areas safely.

\section{Project Management}
In order to reduce the risk within the project, all aspects of potential issues are looked at and are summarised in table \ref{tab:risk}. A Gantt chart of how time should be spent can be seen in figure \ref{fig:Gantt}. 

The project will be designed in stages - first, gaining operation of all the basic sections; movement, image capturing, image detection algorithms etc. These will then be brought together once tested to create the final product. 
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|p{6cm}|p{2cm}|p{6cm}|}\hline
Risk						&	Severity	&	Prevention \\ \hline
Parts not arriving on time	&	High		&	Order parts as early as possible \\
Project not fulfilling specification				&	High		&	Develop in stages to obtain functionality in parts. Ensure enough time is allocated to the project.	\\
PCB Design is incorrect		&	Medium		&	Check the design carefully and get second opinion \\
Failure of personal computer causing data loss & Low	& 	Keep back ups of all work on Devtrack Git repository and Dropbox.\\
