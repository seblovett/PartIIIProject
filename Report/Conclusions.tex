%\section{Conclusion}

So far the project has completed three aspects of the whole design: image acquisition, object matching a range finding. So far, all these aspects have been developed separately on different platforms, on a ATMega644P or in MATLAB. 

A full image can be read from a camera and stored on an SD card in a FAT32 filesystem. This gives the ability of removable memory that can be viewed on a computer to see any internal logs that have been written. Images are stored in QVGA format (320 by 240 pixels) as a bitmap image. 

Multiple comparison algorithms have been investigated and compared. They were then all tested using the same image. It was clear that, although at a sacrifice of computations, the normalised cross correlation is the best measure to use.

Range finding equations were then derived. These use the characteristics of the camera and the separation distance between them. 

The next steps will be bringing the comparison and range equations together so as to be able to choose an object in a scene and find the range to said object. Object detection algorithms need to be looked into so that an object in the view can be detected and decided upon where it is. 

Robot movement also needs developing. An accurate method to move a distance will be implemented with a proportional or PID controller. 

A printed circuit board will also be designed with an AVR32 as the microcontroller and all extra hardware on the board will be included. This will then mean all modules (image acquisition, comparison, range finding etc.) can be ported to the AVR32 and the robot can then be made mobile. Further parts can then be developed such as the occupancy map and search algorithms. 

All modules will be tested before being implemented. The final hardware design and development is to be completed by \date{15th March 2013} and the project report hand-in date is 1st May 2013.
