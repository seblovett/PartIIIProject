%\section{Conclusion}

\inote{What I have accomplished}
This work has led to a tested device which is mobile and has the capability to perform stereoscopic image processing. The system has a motor driving system

The motor system is a simple, cheap method to move distances with reasonable accuracy. A better controller would allow for quicker movement and speed matching between motors.
