%\section{Conclusion}

So far, the project has addressed three aspects of the whole design: image acquisition, object matching and range finding. All these aspects have been developed separately on different platforms; on an ATMega644P or in MATLAB. 

A full image can be read from a camera and stored on an SD card in a FAT32 filesystem. This gives the ability of removable memory that can be viewed on a computer to see any internal logs. Images are stored in QVGA format (320 by 240 pixels) as a bitmap image. 

Multiple comparison algorithms have been investigated and compared using the same test images. It was clear that, although at a necessity of more computations, the normalised cross correlation is the best with regard to overall reliability.

Range finding equations were then derived, which use the characteristics of the camera and the separation distance between them. 

The next steps will be bringing the comparison and range equations together so as to be able to choose an object in a scene and find the range to the object. Object detection algorithms need to be looked into so that an object in view can be detected and correctly located. 

Robot movement also needs development. An accurate method to move a distance will be implemented with a proportional or PID controller. 

A printed circuit board will also be designed. It will use the AT32UC3C0512 and contain motor drivers, \itc multiplexer, camera connections and a TFT screen. This will then mean all modules (image acquisition, comparison, range finding etc.) can be ported to the AVR32 and the robot can be made mobile. Further sections can then be developed such as the occupancy map and search algorithms. 

All modules will be tested before being implemented. The final hardware design and development is to be completed by \date{15th March 2013} and the project report hand-in date is 1st May 2013.
